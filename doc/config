The path to the config is defined in 'CONFIG' atom in ejobman.app file.
The default value is string "/etc/erpher/ejobman.conf". One can use
the config file at the release start to change the default path.
Every item in a list is a {key, value} tuple, where value can be a list again.

The main config is a list containing the following sections:

- rabbit
- web_server_opts
- debug
- handler
- pools
- log

rabbit
======
Section 'rabbit' is used by ejobman_receiver to connect to an AMQP broker.
port - broker's port. Integer. Default: 5672
host - broker's host. Atom. Default: '127.0.0.1'
user - username to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"guest">>
password - password to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"guest">>
vhost - virtual host to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"/">>
exchange - exchange to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"test_exch">>
exchange_type - exchange type to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"topic">>
queue - queue to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"test_queue">>
routing_key - routing key to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"test_rt_key">>

web_server_opts
===============
Section 'web_server_opts' is used by ejobman_handler as a list of parameters
for mochiweb. If the whole section is missing then mochiweb is not started.
port - port to bind. Integer. No default
name - name of a registered process. Atom. No default
ssl - ssl flag. Boolean. No default
ssl_opts - list of ssl options. No default
certfile - path to ssl certificate. Must be part of ssl_opts. String. No default
keyfile  - path to ssl key file. Must be part of ssl_opts. String. No default

debug
=====
Section 'debug' is used by ejobman_receiver. The section is a list of
{key, value} tuples, where key is an atom and value is an integer. The bigger
value is, the more verbose debug logs (and the slower the erlang VM works).
You are warned.
The possible keys:
config - config related information
run - runtime information

handler
=======
Section 'handler' is used by ejobman_handler. The section contains
the following items:

url_rewrite - list of rewrite items. Every rewrite item can contain
the following:
  src_type - type of src_host_part. Optional. Possible values: regex, none.
  Default: none
  src_host_part - string or regex the input host (host only!) is matched
  against. String. Mandatory. No default
  dst_host_part - replacement for the source host (host only!). String.
  The source host is used if dst_host_part is undefined. No default
  dst_host_hdr - string to be used as "Host" header. String. No default

max_children - the max number of disposable children. Integer. Default: 32767

debug - a list of {key, value} tuples, where key is an atom and value is
an integer. The bigger value is, the more verbose debug logs (and the slower
the erlang VM works). You are warned.
The possible keys:
  config - config related information
  run - runtime information
  http - web related information

pools
=====
Section 'pools' is used by ejobman_handler to create pools of workers. The
section is a list of pool items. Each pool item is a list of {key, value}
tuples. The pool item can contain the following item:
  id - pool id. Atom. No default
  min_workers - amount of workers to start in the beginning
  restart_delay - delay in seconds before restarting crashed worker. Integer.
    Default: 10
  restart_policy - policy for restarting crashed worker. Atom. Possible values:
    restart (immediate restart), none (ignore), delay (restart after delay).
    Default: none
  worker_duration - time in seconds for worker to operate. Integer.
    Default: 86400
  worker - list of parameters for worker. Possible keys:
    name - string to be used for spawning. String. No default.
    debug - list of debug items. Possible keys:
      run - runtime information

log
===
Section 'log' is used by ejobman_receiver to setup external logfile.
The value is a directory name and the beginning part of a filename. String.
Default: "/var/log/erpher/ejm"
