rabbit
------

The 'rabbit' section contains AMQP connection parameters.
The parameters:
  port - broker's port. Integer. Default: 5672
  host - broker's host. Atom. Default: '127.0.0.1'
  user - username to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"guest">>
  password - password to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default:
  <<"guest">>
  vhost - virtual host to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"/">>
  exchange - exchange to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default:
  <<"ejobman">>
  exchange_type - exchange type to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary.
  Default: <<"topic">>
  queue - queue to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default:
  <<"test_queue">>
  routing_key - routing key to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default:
  <<"new">>

debug
-----

The 'debug' section keeps parameters for ejobman. The section
is a list of {key, value} tuples, where the key is an atom and the value
is an integer. The bigger value is, the more verbose debug logs (and
the slower the erlang VM works). You are warned.
The possible keys:
  config - config related information
  run - runtime information

group_handler
-------------
job groups and their parameters

jit_log_level - log level for 'just in time' messages. Integer. 0
jit_log_keep_time - time to keep 'just in time' messages. Hours. 72
jit_log_keep_n - number of 'just in time' messages to keep. Integer. 1000
http_connect_timeout - http connect timeout. Milliseconds.
http_timeout - timeout for one job. Milliseconds.
max_children - the max number of disposable children. Integer. Default: 3

job_groups - list of groups. Every group is a list containing k-v tuples with
the following parameters:
  name - name of a group. Binary.
  max_children - Integer. If not found, then max_children from group handler
  is used

schema_rewrite - list of schema rewrite rules. Every item can contain the
following:
  src_type - type of src_host_part. Optional. Possible values: regex, none.
  Default: none
  src_host_part - string or regex the input host (host only!) is matched
  against. String. No default
  https - what to do: true - force https, false - force http, other - don't
  change the input schema.

url_rewrite - list of rewrite items. Every rewrite item can contain
the following:
  src_type - type of src_host_part. Optional. Possible values: regex, none.
  Default: none
  src_host_part - string or regex the input host (host only!) is matched
  against. String. No default
  dst_host_part - replacement for the source host (host only!). String.
  The source host is used if dst_host_part is undefined. No default
  dst_host_hdr - string to be used as "Host" header. String. No default

debug - a list of {key, value} tuples used for every group in the particular
group handler process.
The possible keys:
  run - runtime information
  job - job related
  msg - rabbitmq related

handler
-------

The 'handler' section keeps parameters for ejobman_handler - the process
which spawns group handlers. The section contains the following items:

debug - a list of {key, value} tuples.
The possible keys:
  run - runtime information

log
---
The 'log' section contains parameters that are used by ejobman_receiver
to setup external logfile. If there is no log parameter then no attempt
to setup the logfile is done. It's better to setup only one of
ejobman and eworkman log parameters.
The parameters:
  log - the value is a directory name and the beginning part of a filename.
  String. Default: "/var/log/erpher/ejm"

temp_rt_key_for_group
---------------------
this is a temporary stub. When the input rt key is the same as
the configured temp_rt_key_for_group then the real rt key should be extracted
from the group field of payload
