- check for correct data on receive
- format functions for edoc to work. That means put an empty line (or a line
  with just one dot, he-he...) after a function body
- use catch and/or timeout for ejobman_long_worker:cmd call
  in ejobman_handler_cmd:do_one_long_command. Because we don't want to crash
  handler on worker timeout.
- add api add_pool, add_worker(?)
- compile and store regexp in ejobman_handler config preparation
