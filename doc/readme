Depends
=======

Erlang/OTP R13B3
rabbitmq-erlang-client 2.3.1+hg20110303.1-0ubuntu2
mochiweb 2.0.0 (mochijson2.erl)

Problems
========

- how do we cope with the rabbit client and it's headers? Build process that
  looks great in Unix makes developer to bump ugly in Windows.
  Currently the client is an unzipped copy of the distro's package
  (rabbitmq-erlang-client, 2.3.1+hg20110303.1-0ubuntu2)
  Possible solutions:
  - let it be. Build beam files on linux, use them everywhere. The only parts
    to be changed are start/stop scripts, configs(?), etc.

Workers
=======

There are two types of workers: long living and short living processes.
The min and the max number of long lasting workers are defined in config file
in the handler section (parameters min_workers, max_workers).
The max number of short living processes is also defined in handler section
of the config (parameter max_children)
Long living workers are controlled (spawn, assign a job, terminate)
by ejobman_handler.
