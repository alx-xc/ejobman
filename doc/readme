- how do we cope with the rabbit client and it's headers? Build process that
  looks great in Unix makes developer to bump ugly in Windows.
  Currently the client is an unzipped copy of the distro's package
  (rabbitmq-erlang-client, 2.3.1+hg20110303.1-0ubuntu2)
  Possible solutions:
  - keep it. Build beam files on linux, use them everywhere. The only parts
    to be changed are start/stop scripts, configs(?), etc.
